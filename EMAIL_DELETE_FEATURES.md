# Email Management Features - Delete & Summary Updates

## Overview
Enhanced the AuraLink email management system with individual email deletion and improved AI summary display.

## New Features

### 1. **Full-Length AI Summaries**
- **Previous**: Summaries limited to 80 characters
- **Updated**: Summaries now up to 200 characters for better context
- **Display**: Full summary text shown without truncation in both list and detail views
- **Configuration**: `huggingface.max.summary.length=200` in application.properties

### 2. **Individual Email Deletion**
Delete specific emails instead of clearing all at once.

#### Backend Endpoints

**Delete Sent Email**
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/email/sent/{id}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Sent email deleted successfully"
}
```

**Delete Received Email**
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/email/received/{id}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Received email deleted successfully"
}
```

#### Frontend Features

**In Email List View:**
- üóëÔ∏è Delete button appears next to priority and status badges
- Click the trash icon to delete an email
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Loading state (‚è≥) while deleting

**In Email Detail View:**
- üóëÔ∏è Delete button in the header next to close button
- Red styled button with "Delete" text
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Auto-closes detail view after successful deletion

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### EmailService.java
```java
/**
 * Delete a sent email by ID
 */
public boolean deleteSentEmail(String id) {
    return sentEmails.removeIf(email -> email.getId().equals(id));
}
```

#### EmailReceiverService.java
```java
/**
 * Delete a received email by ID
 */
public boolean deleteReceivedEmail(String id) {
    return receivedEmails.removeIf(email -> email.getId().equals(id));
}
```

#### EmailController.java
Added two new DELETE endpoints:
- `/api/email/sent/{id}` - Delete specific sent email
- `/api/email/received/{id}` - Delete specific received email

Both return 200 OK on success, 404 Not Found if email doesn't exist.

### Frontend Changes

#### EmailService.ts
```typescript
/**
 * Delete a specific sent email by ID
 */
export const deleteSentEmail = async (id: string): Promise<{ message: string }> => {
  const response = await axios.delete<{ message: string }>(`${API_URL}/sent/${id}`);
  return response.data;
};

/**
 * Delete a specific received email by ID
 */
export const deleteReceivedEmail = async (id: string): Promise<{ message: string }> => {
  const response = await axios.delete<{ message: string }>(`${API_URL}/received/${id}`);
  return response.data;
};
```

#### EmailList.tsx
**Props Updated:**
- Added `emailType?: 'sent' | 'received'` prop
- Determines which delete API to call

**New State:**
- `deleting: string | null` - Tracks which email is being deleted

**Handler Function:**
```typescript
const handleDeleteEmail = async (emailId: string, e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.stopPropagation(); // Prevent email selection
  
  if (!window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this email?')) {
    return;
  }

  setDeleting(emailId);
  try {
    if (emailType === 'sent') {
      await deleteSentEmail(emailId);
    } else if (emailType === 'received') {
      await deleteReceivedEmail(emailId);
    }
    
    if (selectedEmail?.id === emailId) {
      setSelectedEmail(null);
    }
    
    if (onRefresh) {
      onRefresh();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting email:', error);
    alert('Failed to delete email. Please try again.');
  } finally {
    setDeleting(null);
  }
};
```

#### EmailDashboard.tsx
Updated EmailList components to include `emailType` prop:
```tsx
<EmailList
  emails={sentEmails}
  title="Sent Emails"
  onRefresh={loadSentEmails}
  loading={loading}
  emailType="sent"
/>

<EmailList
  emails={receivedEmails}
  title="Received Emails"
  onRefresh={handleFetchNewEmails}
  loading={loading}
  emailType="received"
/>
```

## UI/UX Features

### Delete Button Styling
**In List View:**
- Small trash icon (üóëÔ∏è)
- Semi-transparent by default
- Highlights on hover with light red background
- Disabled state while deleting

**In Detail View:**
- Red button with text "üóëÔ∏è Delete"
- Prominent placement in header
- Changes to "‚è≥ Deleting..." during operation
- Disabled during deletion

### User Experience
1. **Confirmation**: Always asks for confirmation before deleting
2. **Feedback**: Visual loading state during deletion
3. **Auto-refresh**: List automatically refreshes after successful deletion
4. **Error handling**: Shows alert if deletion fails
5. **State management**: Closes detail view if deleted email was selected

## CSS Additions

### EmailList.css
```css
.delete-email-btn {
  background: none;
  border: none;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 2px 6px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: background-color 0.2s;
  opacity: 0.7;
}

.delete-email-btn:hover:not(:disabled) {
  background-color: #ffebee;
  opacity: 1;
}

.delete-detail-btn {
  padding: 6px 12px;
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 13px;
  font-weight: 500;
  transition: background-color 0.2s;
}

.delete-detail-btn:hover:not(:disabled) {
  background-color: #d32f2f;
}

.email-details-actions {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Configuration

### Summary Length
File: `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`

```properties
# Increase from 80 to 200 for fuller summaries
huggingface.max.summary.length=200
```

## API Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| DELETE | `/api/email/sent/{id}` | Delete specific sent email | `{ "message": "Sent email deleted successfully" }` |
| DELETE | `/api/email/received/{id}` | Delete specific received email | `{ "message": "Received email deleted successfully" }` |
| DELETE | `/api/email/sent` | Clear all sent emails | `{ "message": "Sent emails cleared successfully" }` |
| DELETE | `/api/email/received` | Clear all received emails | `{ "message": "Received emails cleared successfully" }` |

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Backend**: Server running on port 8080 ‚úÖ
2. **Frontend**: Dev server running on port 5173 ‚úÖ
3. **Send Test Email**: Use Compose tab to send a test email
4. **Receive Email**: Wait for scheduled fetch or click "Fetch New Emails"
5. **Test Delete**: Click delete button on any email
6. **Verify**: Email should be removed from list
7. **Test Summary**: Check that AI summaries display full text (up to 200 chars)

### cURL Testing
```bash
# Delete a sent email
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/email/sent/{email-id}"

# Delete a received email
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/email/received/{email-id}"
```

## Error Handling

### Backend
- Returns 404 if email ID not found
- Returns 500 on internal errors
- Logs all deletion attempts

### Frontend
- Catches and displays errors to user
- Prevents multiple simultaneous deletions
- Maintains UI state consistency

## Security Considerations
- No authentication required (add if needed)
- Client-side confirmation before deletion
- Server-side validation of email ID
- CORS configured for frontend access

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Undo deletion (trash/archive system)
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple emails
- [ ] Permanent vs. soft delete
- [ ] Delete confirmation with checkbox
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Delete key)
- [ ] Email archiving instead of deletion
