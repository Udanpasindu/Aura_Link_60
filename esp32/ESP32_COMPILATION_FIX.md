# ESP32 Code Compilation Fix - Complete âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Variable Declaration Order**
**Problem:** Variables were declared AFTER the functions that use them, causing "not declared in this scope" errors.

**Solution:** Moved all data structures, enums, and global variables to the TOP of the file (lines 62-126), BEFORE any function definitions.

### 2. **Deprecated ArduinoJson API**
**Problem:** `DynamicJsonDocument` is deprecated in newer ArduinoJson versions.

**Solution:** Replaced all instances with `JsonDocument`:
- Line 171: `handleEmailNotification()` 
- Line 218: `handlePriorityEmailNotification()`
- Line 529: `publishSensorData()`

### 3. **Duplicate Declarations**
**Problem:** Data structures were declared twice (once at top, once near bottom).

**Solution:** Removed duplicate declarations from lines 549-602 (old location).

## Code Structure (Corrected Order)

```cpp
1. Include statements (#include)
2. Configuration constants (WiFi, MQTT)
3. Hardware component initialization (WiFi, MQTT, LCD, DHT)
4. Timing configuration (intervals, durations)
5. Pin definitions (#define)
6. âœ… Data structures (SensorReadings, EmailStats)
7. âœ… Global variables (currentReadings, emailStats, currentDisplay, etc.)
8. âœ… Enums (DisplayState)
9. âœ… Constant arrays (suggestions[])
10. Function definitions (setup_wifi, mqtt_callback, handlers, etc.)
11. setup() function
12. loop() function
```

## Hardware Pin Configuration

| Pin | Component | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 19 | Blue LED | Unread emails indicator |
| 18 | Red LED | Priority emails indicator |
| 17 | Green LED | Good environment indicator (blinks) |
| 27 | Buzzer | Email notifications & WiFi alerts |
| 13 | LED | Ambient light control |
| 25 | PIR | Motion detection |
| 33 | LDR | Light sensor |
| 34 | MQ-135 | Gas/air quality sensor |
| 32 | DHT22 | Temperature & humidity |
| 21 | I2C SDA | LCD communication |
| 22 | I2C SCL | LCD communication |

## Features Implemented

### ðŸ”µ Blue LED (Pin 19)
- **ON**: When there are unread emails
- **OFF**: When all emails are read

### ðŸ”´ Red LED (Pin 18)
- **ON**: When there are unread priority emails
- **OFF**: When all priority emails are read

### ðŸŸ¢ Green LED (Pin 17)
- **Blinking**: When environment is good (air quality + temp + humidity optimal)
- **OFF**: When environment conditions are not optimal

### ðŸ”Š Buzzer Patterns (Pin 27)
- **3 short beeps** (200ms): New email received
- **4 long beeps** (400ms): Priority email received
- **1 beep**: All emails marked as read
- **2 beeps**: Priority emails marked as read
- **Continuous beep**: WiFi disconnected (1 second intervals)

### ðŸ“± LCD Display (20x4)

**Mode 1: Sensor View** (Default)
```
T:25.3Â°C H:65%
Emails:5/P:2
CO2:450ppm
Air:Good    WiFi+
```

**Mode 2: Email Summary** (10 seconds after new email)
```
*** NEW EMAIL ***
[First 20 characters]
[Next 20 characters ]
[Last 20 characters ]
```

**Mode 3: Contextual Suggestions** (5s every 30s)
```
*** SUGGESTION ***

Urgent: 2 priority!
```

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Features

1. **Contextual Suggestions** - Priority-based suggestions:
   - Priority emails alert (highest priority)
   - Unread emails reminder
   - Air quality warnings
   - Temperature/humidity alerts
   - Generic motivational messages

2. **80-Character Email Summaries** - Displays email summaries up to 80 characters across 3 LCD lines

3. **MQTT Integration** - Subscribes to:
   - `iot/email/notifications` - Email statistics
   - `iot/email/new` - New email alerts with summary
   - `iot/email/priority` - Priority email alerts
   - `iot/email/allread` - All emails read notification
   - `iot/email/priorityread` - Priority emails read

4. **Sensor Data Publishing** - Publishes to `auralink/sensors` every 5 seconds:
   - Temperature, Humidity
   - CO2, NH3, CH4, CO levels
   - Air quality status
   - Light level, Motion detection

## Compilation Status

âœ… **All errors fixed**
âœ… **Deprecation warnings resolved**
âœ… **Code structure optimized**
âœ… **Ready to upload to ESP32**

## WiFi Settings

- **SSID:** `KEEN SYSTEMS PVT LTD 8`
- **Password:** `Kushan@0608`
- **MQTT Broker:** `broker.hivemq.com:1883`
- **Client ID:** `ESP32_AuraLink_Client`

## Upload Instructions

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Select **Board:** "ESP32 Dev Module"
3. Select correct **Port**
4. Click **Upload** (Ctrl+U)
5. Wire the 3 LEDs (Blue=Pin19, Red=Pin18, Green=Pin17) with 220Î© resistors
6. Wire buzzer to Pin 27
7. Power on ESP32
8. Check serial monitor (115200 baud) for status messages
